A bunch of mini-preact components for building arduino configuration websites

## Configuring Arduino Projects

I like building Arduino Projects. I like to use the ESP8266 for those projects. I don't like hardcoding my WIFI details in code. Thankfully, it is possible to run an ESP8266 in "AP" mode and create what is called a _Capitivate Portal_.

These components allow me to quickly throw together a lightweight UI for my projects.
